# Implementation_of_CMOS-inverter_design_using_SkyWater_SKY-130_PDK
This projects aims to experiment with working of an inverter and understanding all the related parameters. The design will utilise the models that are present under the skywater 130nm pdk and various open source tools such as, Xschem, NGSPICE, MAGIC, Netgen, etc.
